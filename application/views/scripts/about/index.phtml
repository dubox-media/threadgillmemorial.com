					Threadgill Memorial Services takes great effort to honor and support a family who has lost a loved one!  It is important to understand "family culture" and family dynamics while making choices and considering options.
				</p>
				<p>
					When making decisions, it is important to note that there is not an economic requirement for services to meet each family memberâ€™s needs.  What is required is communication, consideration and respect.
				</p>
				<p>
					We honor and usher the individuals and families through this difficult process and assist them in bridging their future needs and current feelings with the present.
				</p>
				<p>
					We make funeral arrangements in the homes of the families we serve or a place of their choosing allowing them to be more comfortable. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We facilitate funerals all over the Portland area assisting families in staying close to their homes or the cemetery of their choice.  We have also facilitated funerals in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and California.  
				</p>
				<p>
					We have transported casketed and cremated human remains throughout the United States and several foreign countries.
